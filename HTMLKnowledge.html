      <h2>HTML Knowledge</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>HTML elements give structure to your web page. <br> It is important to note
        that HTML elements that enclose any text must start with < tag> format, and
          end with
          < tag /> format.</p>

      <h4>Containers:</h4>
      <p>The < div >, < section >, < header >, < article > and < footer > tags are all examples
      of containers to hold other HTML elements. These containers are particularly helpful
      when styling your webpage. The table, form and fieldset tags mentioned below are
      also examples of containers.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Italics and Emphasis:</h4>
      <p>The < i> tag makes text italic, while the < em> tag makes text italic as well as
            telling search engines that the word is important to the content of the page. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Bold and Strong:</h4>
      <p>The < b> tag makes text bold, while the < strong> tag makes text bold as well as
            telling search engines that the word is important to the content of the page.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Hyperlink:</h4>
      <p>The < a> tag will create a hyperlink of the text inside. For this a tag we also need
          to include the hyperlink reference (href) of the page we want to travel to.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Ordered and Unordered Lists:</h4>
      <p>The < or> tag will create a list with a numbering system in front of it. The type of
          numbering system can be changed with an attribute inside the tag. <br> And the < ul> tag
            will create a bullet point list. <br> Both of these tags need an < li> tag inside to create the
              list items. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Images:</h4>
      <p>The < img> tag will create an image in the webpage. For this tag we need to add
          the source of the image, whether it is local from your computer, or taken from the
          internet. We also should add alternative text, that will display in the case the
          picture cannot be loaded. Often CSS elements are essential to making an image usable
          in a web page.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Horizontal Line:</h4>
      <p>The < hr> tag will create a horizontal line across your page, and does not require an end tag.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Paragraphs:</h4>
      <p>The < p > tag will create a paragraph of text.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>HTML Tables:</h4>
      <p>The tag < table > tag will create the area to enter your data. Some important attributes
        of this tag are: the border="n" attribute to outline the borders of the table, as well as
        the cellspacing="n" and cellpadding="n" attributes to spread the table out. However,
        this is ideally done in CSS. Inside this table tag we need < tr > tags to create rows.
        Inside this table row tag we also need < td > tags to create the columns of the table.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Column and Row Spanning:</h4>
      <p>We can also combine rows and columns together to create our desired table with the
        colspan="n" and rowspan="n" attributes inside the table row and table data tags.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Forms:</h4>
        <p>HTML forms are used when you want to collect data from the web-site visitors. <br> HTML
          tags are used to create the front end of the form, however without JavaScript
          we will not be able to use it's full functionalities. <br> First, we can create a grouping
          of inputs and we can do this using the < fieldset > tag, and we can give this fieldset a
          name by using the < legend > tag. <br> Often we will want to connect a label to our input boxes.
          We can do this by using the < label > tag. To connect the two, we use the for="" attribute
          inside the label tag, and the id="" attribute inside the input tag, and assign them the same name.
          <br> Another helpful attribute is the placeholder="" attribute. What we enter into this placeholder
          attribute will appear in grey text before the user clicks on the input box. <br> The
          < input type="text" > tag gives us a text input box. <br> The < input type="email" > tag has automatic
          parameters that can recognize if there is not a valid email provided. <br> The < select > tag will create
          a drop down menu. inside this tag the < option > tag will create the options to click on. <br> The < textarea >
          tag will create a multi-line text box. <br> The < input type="checkbox" > tag will give a checkbox,
          these will also need a label attached to each option. <br> And the < input type="submit" > tag will create a button.</p>
