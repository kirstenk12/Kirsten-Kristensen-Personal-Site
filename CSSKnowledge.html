        <p>CSS can be written in three places: inline, embedded, and in an external
          style sheet. Our best option out of these is to use an external style sheet
          and link it to your HTML page. To link these pages we use the < link > tag
          with an href attribute leading to your style sheet.</p>

        <h4>Selectors</h4>
        <p>one of the most important parts of styling your website is knowing how to use
          CSS selectors. This is how we select separate elements of our HTML code.</p>
          <br>
        <h4>Star Selector:</h4>
        <p>The *{} selector will select everything in your webpage, this is useful in
          setting margins and padding for the whole page, and perhaps giving a background
          color or picture to your whole webpage.</p>
          <br>
        <h4>Class Selector:</h4>
        <p>The class selector will select elements with a specific class attribute in the
          HTML code. To set a class to an HTML element we use the syntax class="NameOfClass"
          inside the HTML tag. In the CSS file we use the syntax .NameOfClass{} to select
          all elements with that class name. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>ID Selector:</h4>
          <p>Similar to the class selector, for the ID selector we set an ID to a HTML tag using
            the syntax id="NameOfID" inside the HTML tag and the syntax #NameOfID inside
            the CSS page. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Element Selector:</h4>
          <p>Using the element selector will select all elements in your HTML page with the selected element.
            for example if we were to use the syntax p{}, this would select all paragraph elements in
            your HTML page.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Descendant Selector:</h4>
          <p>We can use the descendant selector by specifying a parent and then a child HTML element, such as
             div p{} . Using this selector all paragraphs under a div will be selected.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Pseudo Class Selector:</h4>
          <p>pseudo class selectors are pre-defined groupings used in CSS to deal with special situations
            that do not exist in standard HTML. some examples of pseudo class selectors include:  element:link{}
            element:visited{}  element:hover{}</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Sibling Selector:</h4>
          <p>the sibling selector uses the syntax p~ul{}, and will select every unordered list that is preceded
             by a paragraph.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Adjacent Selector:</h4>
          <p>The adjacent selector is similar to the sibling selector, however it uses the syntax p+ul{}, and will
             only select the unordered list when it is immediately after a paragraph.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Nth-Of-Type Selector:</h4>
          <p>The nth of type selector is particularly useful when there are no classes or ID's in the HTML code.
             it uses the syntax element:nth-of-type(n){}. For example, if we put p:nth-of-type(odd){}, all of the
             odd numbered paragraphs would be selected.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Nth-Child Selector:</h4>
          <p>Similarly the nth-child selector is also very useful when there are no classes or ID's in your HTML
             code, and are often used in conjunction with an additional element selector. The nth child selector
             uses the syntax element:nth-child(n){}. This means that only if the element specified is the nth
             child of its parent will it be selected. In addition we often use it in conjunction with additional
             element selector, for example: div p:nth-child(2){}. In this case the paragraph that is the second
             element in a div will be selected. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Colors:</h4>
          <p>We can give color to many things in CSS, using various ways to select a color. There are simple
            colors like red;, blue;, gray;, orange;, purple; etc. that are keywords built in. Or we can use the syntax
            rgb(n,n,n); to select a specific color. Another method is the rgba(n,n,n,n.n); syntax that will give a
            specific color as well as giving it a level of transparency. And the final method of selecting colors is
            the hexadecimal color system. A helpful website for choosing colors that complement each other is
            <a href="https://Colorhunt.co" target="_blank" id="colors">Color Hunt</a>. The syntax for the hexadecimal
            color system is #nnnnnn; to select a color. Using the color: syntax inside the curly brackets we can give
            color to text. Using the background: syntax we can give a color to the entire background, the background
            of a div or the background of a element.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Background Images:</h4>
          <p>We can also set an image as a background. To do this we need to use a couple of properties.
             The {background:url(...);} syntax will set the image as a background to the body or a div. Other important
             properties include background-repeat: , background-size: and background-position: . These properties can set your
             background image to cover the page, repeat or not repeat, be center aligned or any number of attributes desired
             for your background image.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Borders:</h4>
          <p>We can add borders to divs, pictures etc. by using the syntax border: . Like background images there
            are a number of important properties associated with giving a border such as the style of
            border(solid, dotted, dashed, double etc.), the width of the border, the color of the border, and setting
            rounded borders. However, it is easier to use the shorthand so as to use only one property.
            For example p{border: solid 5px black} will give a solid, black square border 5 pixels in width.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>CSS Box Models:</h4>
          <p>Some of the most important properties of the CSS box model is the margin: , padding: , height: and width:
            properties. We can set these using pixels, percentages and the view width (vw) and view height (vh)
            settings. The margin properties can move the div from the top, left, right or bottom.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Display Properties:</h4>
          <p>There are multiple display properties that does different things. <br> The display: block; property
            displays an element as a block element (like a paragraph), it starts on a new line, and takes up the whole
            width of the page. <br> The display: inline; property displays an element as an inline element, meaning there
            can be more than one element on a certain line, and any height and width properties will have no effect. <br>
            The display:inline-block; property displays an element as an inline block level container. The element
            itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values. <br> The display: none;
            property will set this element to not be displayed on the screen, you could also use the property
            visibility: hidden; the only different is that the display property none will not be displayed or take up any
            space, whereas hidden will not be displayed but will take up space on the page. <br> The display: flex;
            property displays an element as a block-level flex container. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Position Property:</h4>
          <p>Like display properties there are multiple position properties that do different things. <br> The
             position: absolute; property defines the position of a given bounding box from the top and left side
             margins of the web page. This not only allows objects to be placed in an exact location, it also allows
             objects to be placed one on top of another. <br> The position: relative; property defines the positioning in
             such a way that elements are offset from the previous element in the html code. This allows objects to be
             placed in relation to one another. <br> The position: fixed; property defines the position of a given box
             relative to the window and remains in its specified location even as the content scrolls underneath it. <br> A
             similar property is the float: property that can wrap content around other content (such as text around a picture),
             you can use the float property. The float property determines on which side of the bounding box the element
             aligns so that the other wraps around it. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Embedding Fonts:</h4>
          <p>The only way to 100% guarantee that the user will be able to see the exact same font that you design with,
            is by using font embedding. <br> a helpful website to find free fonts to embed is
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" id="fonts">Google Fonts</a>. <br> To embed a font we have
            to link a font in the HTML page using the syntax < link rel="" href="" >, and apply it to our text by naming the font
            name in our CSS stylesheet. for example p{font-family: ;}</p>
